# About the project
### Programming Project #3: Implementing HashTable
  This project was requested by a basic data structure teacher, Selan Rodrigues dos Santos, from UFRN, with the porpuse to implement a HashTable
  In this project was implemented a class called HashTbl that follows the ADT Hashtable design and store pointers to a list of  elements collided, dynamically. Further, was used the Google Tests to verify the correct functioning of each method.

### Installing
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/natanlimap/HashTable.git
```
2. Install Google Tests
```sh
https://github.com/google/googletest

3. On project's root path, delete "build"  

4. Use this command on terminal
cmake -S . -Bbuild
```

## Running the tests
1. Enter in the build path

2. On terminal, use this commands
```sh
make
./run_tests
```
## The tests

This tests will show if the implementation of each method of HashTable class is running as expected.

## Acknowledgments

It is also important to remind that some parts of this code were inspired by classroom implementations with the presence and participation of the Basic Data Structure 1 discipline's teacher and classmates in 2019.2, taught by Selan Rodrigues dos Santos, from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte.
Further, these files: main.cpp, account.cpp, account.h and driver_ht.cpp were made by Selan Rodrigues dos Santos.
